# Writing a Paper

## 1. Scope

An effective exercise is to write down everything that motivated you to start the research. What did you want to achieve? What problems did you expect to address? What makes the  problems interesting? Next, deﬁne the scope of the work that you plan to write up. To do so, it is necessary to make choices about what to include, and thus it is necessary to  identify what might be included.

You might start, for example, by asking questions such as:
* Which results are the most surprising?
* What is the one result that other researchers might adopt in their work?
* Are the other outcomes independent enough to be published separately later on?
Are they interesting enough to justify their being included?
* Does it make sense to explain the new algorithms ﬁrst, followed by description of
the previous algorithms in terms of how they differ from the new work? Or is the
contribution of the new work more obvious if the old approaches are described
ﬁrst, to set the context?
* What assumptions or deﬁnitions need to be formalized before the main theorem
can be presented?
* What is the key background work that has to be discussed?
* Who is the readership? For example, are you writing for specialists in your area,
your examiners, or a general computer science audience?

## 2. Storytelling

A cornerstone of good writing is identifying what the reader needs to learn. A strong
thesis or paper has a story-like ﬂow, with a sequence of concepts building from a
foundation of knowledge assumed to be common to all readers up to new ideas and
results. Thus an effective paper educates its readers. It leads readers from what they
already know to new knowledge you want them to learn. For this reason, the body
of a good paper—everything between the introduction and the conclusions—should
have a logical ﬂow that has the feel of a narrative.

There are several common ways for structuring the body of a paper, including as
a chain, by speciﬁcity, by example, and by complexity.

### 2.1 Chain

Chain in which the results and the background on which they build dictate a logical order for presentation of the material. 
First might come, say, a problem statement, then a review of previous solutions and
their drawbacks, then the new solution, and ﬁnally a demonstration that the solution
improves on its predecessors.

### 2.2 Speciﬁcity

An approach that is particularly appropriate for results that
can be divided into several stages. The material is ﬁrst outlined in general terms, then
the details are progressively ﬁlled in. Most technical papers have this organization
at the high level, but it can also be used within sections.

### 2.3 Example

In which the idea or result is initially explained by, say, applying it to some typical problem. Then the idea can be explained more formally, in a framework the example has made concrete and familiar.

### 2.4 Complexity

A simple case can be given ﬁrst, then a more complex case can be explained as an extension,
thus avoiding the difﬁculty of explaining foundational concepts in a complex frame-
work. This approach is a kind of tutorial: the reader is brought by small steps to the
full result.

## 3. Organization

cientiﬁc papers follow a standard structure that allows readers to quickly dis-
cover the main results, and then, if interested, to examine the supporting evidence.
Many readers accept or reject conclusions based on a quick scan, not having time
to read all the papers they see.

You need to:
* Describe the work in the context of accepted scientiﬁc knowledge.
* State the idea that is being investigated, often as a theory or hypothesis.
* Explain what is new about the idea, what is being evaluated, or what contribution
the paper is making.
* Justify the theory, by methods such as proof or experiment


## 4. Abstract

An abstract is typically a single paragraph of about 50–200 words. The function
of an abstract is to allow readers to judge whether or not the paper is of relevance
to them.

Thus a draft of an abstract can consist of ﬁve sentences, one for each of the points
above.

1. Deneral area of research: A general statement introducing the broad research area of the particular topic being investigated.
2. Problem: An explanation of the speciﬁc problem (difﬁculty, obstacle, challenge) to be solved
3. Review previous solutions: A review of existing or standard solutions to this problem and their limitations.
4. New solution: An outline of the proposed new solution.
5. Evaluation: A summary of how the solution was evaluated and what the outcomes of the
evaluation were.


Many scientists browse research papers outside their area of expertise. You should
not assume that all likely readers will be specialists in the topic of the paper—abstracts
should be self-contained and written for as broad a readership as possible.

## 5. Introduction

An introduction can be regarded as an expanded version of the abstract. It should
describe the paper’s topic, the problem being studied, references to key papers, the
approach to the solution, the scope and limitations of the solution, and the outcomes.
There needs to be enough detail to allow readers to decide whether or not they need
to read further. It should include motivation: the introduction should explain why the problem is interesting, what the relevant scientiﬁc issues are, why the approach
taken is a good one, and why the outcomes are signiﬁcant.

1. Topic
2. Problem being studied
3. References to key papers
4. Approach to the solution
5. Scope
6. Outcomes

By the end of the introduction, the reader should understand the scope of the
work, and of the problem. The reader should also understand the contribution, that is, what the discovery of the work is—the core idea that the referees or examiners need to appreciate as novel and important.

## 6.Body

The body of a paper should present the results. This presentation should provide
necessary background and terminology, explain the chain of reasoning that leads to
the conclusions, provide the details of central proofs, summarize any experimental
outcomes, and state in detail the conclusions outlined in the introduction. 

1. Background
2. Previous work
3. Proposal
4. Experiment
5. Analysis
6. Results
7. Discussion


## 7. Conclusion

This section should include a concise statement of the paper’s important
results and an explanation of their signiﬁcance. This is an appropriate place to state
(or restate) any limitations of the work: shortcomings in the experiments, problems
that the theory does not address, and so on

1. Important Results
2. Significance
3. Experiment Shortcomings
4. Problems Not Solved by Theory
5. Possible Consequences of Results
